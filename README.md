Marionette Demo
===================

This is a demo of a 'todo' application using Marionette. It's based on Sinatra, so after bundling your gems:

	bundle install

You should be able to get away with starting the server by:

	ruby todo.rb
	
Once the server's started, to view the static site visit:

	http://localhost:4567
	
To view the Marionette powered site, visit:

	http://localhost:4567/index.html

and hit "Begin!" (yes, I'm working on autoloading...)
